## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite] (https://vitejs.dev/) - JS build system
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Types for JS
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Vitest] (https://vitest.dev/) - For unit testing

### What I learned

Once again I learned heaps completing a Front End Mentor project.
This was the first project I had done with Tailwind, which I really like.
It was also the first time I had switched from Create React App to the Vite build system.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - The Tailwind docs are really excellent.
